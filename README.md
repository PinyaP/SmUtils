# SmUtils ‚Äì Contract Explorer & Deploy Contract

## Overview

This project is a modern dApp toolkit built on top of [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2), providing two main features for Ethereum smart contract developers and users:

1. **Contract Explorer** ‚Äì Interact with any deployed contract on Sepolia by pasting its address and ABI, even if it is not verified.
2. **Deploy Contract** ‚Äì Compile and deploy your own smart contracts directly to the Sepolia Testnet, with a simple UI workflow.

Built with Next.js, Wagmi, Viem, Framer Motion, and Typescript.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. Contract Explorer

- **Purpose:**  
  Allows users to interact with any smart contract deployed on Sepolia, even if the contract is not verified on Etherscan.
- **How it works:**  
  - Paste the contract address and ABI into the explorer.
  - The app will bring you to a debug page where you can interact with all the contract's functions and view its state.
- **Use case:**  
  Useful for developers and users who want to test, debug, or interact with contracts that are not verified or are under development.

### 2. Deploy Contract

- **Purpose:**  
  Enables users to compile and deploy Solidity smart contracts directly from the web interface.
- **How it works:**  
  - Paste or write your Solidity contract in the editor.
  - Click **Compile** to check for errors and prepare the contract.
  - Once compilation is successful, the **Deploy** button becomes active.
  - Deploy your contract to the Sepolia Testnet.
- **Note:**  
  - Currently, deployment is supported only on the Sepolia Testnet.
  - You must compile before you can deploy.

## üìù Usage

### Contract Explorer

1. Go to the home page.
2. Select the network (Sepolia).
3. Enter the contract address and paste the ABI, or upload an ABI file.
4. Click **Check Contract Exist** and **Check ABI**.
5. If the contract exists, click **Submit** to go to the debug page and interact with the contract.

### Deploy Contract

1. Go to the **Deploy Contract** page.
2. Paste or write your Solidity contract in the editor.
3. Click **Compile**.
4. Once compilation is successful (green check appears), click **Deploy**.
5. Follow MetaMask prompts to deploy to Sepolia.
